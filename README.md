## Vercel Speed Insights (optional)

If you want to collect performance metrics via Vercel Speed Insights in production, follow these steps:

1. Install the package in your project locally (run on your machine):

```powershell
npm install @vercel/speed-insights
```

2. Vercel offers a managed integration â€” enable Speed Insights in your Vercel project settings. See the Vercel docs for details.

3. Add the `SpeedInsightsWrapper` component somewhere in your app layout (for example in `src/main.tsx` or in a production-only layout component):

```tsx
import SpeedInsightsWrapper from "@/components/SpeedInsightsWrapper";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* your app */}
      {process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" && <SpeedInsightsWrapper />}
    </>
  );
}
```

Note: This repo adds `@vercel/speed-insights` to `package.json` and includes `src/components/SpeedInsightsWrapper.tsx`, but you still need to run `npm install` locally and enable the integration in your Vercel dashboard. Deployment to production is required for Speed Insights to collect data.
